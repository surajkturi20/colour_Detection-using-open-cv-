"# colour_Detection-using-open-cv-" 
This is a simple color detection project using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library in Python. The project aims to identify and highlight specific colors in an image or real-time video feed.
#Introduction
Color detection is a fundamental task in computer vision applications. In this project, we leverage OpenCV's powerful capabilities to identify and extract particular colors from an image or video stream. We use Python for the implementation, making it easy to understand and modify.
The project consists of a Python script that takes an image or accesses the device's camera to perform real-time color detection. It applies image processing techniques to detect and highlight the specified colors in the chosen media.
